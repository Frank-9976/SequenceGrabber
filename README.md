## SequenceGrabber TIME RANGE SUPPORT
This program will download all of a user's sequences on [OnlineSequencer](https://onlinesequencer.net/).

Sequences are downloaded to the directory that the program is located in, inside of a subdirectory named the User ID you entered. Duplicate sequences are not downloaded.

NOW WITH TIME RANGE SUPPORT!

### Download

I made a GitHub account for this, and thus I will have to figure this one out.

### Usage

Enter your user ID to download your sequences. Your user ID is the number located at the end of the URL bar on your profile page.

Then enter your minimum and maximum id numbers!

The old program was made in Python, and converted to a .exe file using Pyinstaller. I haven't converted it yet.
